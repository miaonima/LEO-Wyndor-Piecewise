# LEO-Wyndor-Piecewise
Implementation of a Learning Enabled Optimization framework on WYNDOR data.

Requires the following packages: pyomo pandas numpy sklearn.
Also cplex is required for MIQP solutions. If using heuristic solutions, only LP solver is required.

Currently only running heuristic solution for Google Colab:
